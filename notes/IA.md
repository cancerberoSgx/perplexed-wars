basicaly IA could have a resolver or a listener for beginnewturn and decide what to do w the resources / board it has. Is pure logic since it wil lonly need to trigger actions to reducers (what happens after clicking)

a very simple one is just wait to have enough many for the first unit and buy it rright away placing it in the first box available.
