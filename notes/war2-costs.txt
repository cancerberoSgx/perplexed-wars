   1.3 Suggested build order
   -------------------------

   In most games you start with only one Peasant/Peon. You
   obviously need to first build a Town Hall/Great Hall.
   Follow this by a farm. Once your Peasant/Peon (Pe) finishes
   building the farm, click on your Hall and produce a second
   (Pe). Make the first (Pe) build a second farm. Get your second
   (Pe) to build a barracks. Produce your 3rd, 4th, 5th (Pe).

   Below is a summary of the order I would build items:

   *** Note: This assumes your initial resources are normal or
             set to high. For low resource settings you need to
             build Hall, Farm, harvest gold, produce Pe 2, harvest
             more gold, produce Pe 3, harvest gold, build farm 2.

   (Pe 1) Build Hall
   Hall [produce Pe 2]
   (Pe 1) Build Farm
   Hall [produce Pe 3]
   (Pe 2) Build Farm2
   (Pe 1) Build Barracks
   (Pe 3) Build Blacksmith
   Hall [produce Pe 4]
   (Pe 2) Harvest Gold
   (Pe 4) Build Lumber Mill
   Hall [produce Pe 5]
   Barracks [produce Grunt 1]
   Blacksmith [upgrade Shield Strength]
   (Pe 1) Harvest Lumber
   (Pe 3) Harvest Lumber
   (Pe 4) Harvest Gold
   (Pe 5) Harvest Gold

   This order should get your war-machine up and running smoothly.
   Keep producing (Pe) to harvest gold and lumber so that these
   resources are coming in very quickly. Spend as soon as you can
   on upgrades for your troops. Also build 2-4 more farms as your
   number of people grow. As soon as you can afford to, upgrade
   your Hall for the gold bonus and new buildings that become
   available.
   Your choice of buildings now largely depends on your overall
   strategy as you should by now have a steady flow of incoming
   resources. Again upgrade your Hall for the third time to gain
   the bonuses plus gain access to the most advanced buildings and
   units.

3. Using magic
==============

   3.1 Paladins/Ogre Mages
   -----------------------

   Playing as humans you should upgrade your Knights to Paladins
   as soon as possible. The only useful spell is healing but it is
   impossible to cast in the heat of battle. Much better when your
   troops are recovering between attacks. Healing is mana expensive
   so I don't really rate it highly. Exorcism at first glance appears
   to be a totally useless spell. However, it should be used aggressively
   against Death Knights since it will nearly kill them outright from
   a long range.

   Playing as orcs you should upgrade your Ogres to Ogre-Mages
   as soon as possible. Bloodlust is a great spell to use before
   you launch an attack. Ensure you have a group of ogre-mages
   then bloodlust all your troops and send them on the offensive.
   Runes are magical traps that once cast will explode anything that
   walks into its path. Use them in narrow passes where you expect
   the enemy to send its troops through. Alternatively you can take
   advantage of the ogre-mage's long range of casting by sneeking up
   to the enemy whilst keeping out of sight, then casting runes close
   to the enemy horde. Move toward the enemy and lure them into the
   trap.


   3.2 Mages/Death Knights
   -----------------------

   Mages can use fireball on enemy's from long distance. It is mana
   expensive and not very effective. Slow is a defensive spell which
   you would use against fast moving troops such as ogres or against
   catapults to limit their damage potential. Flame Shield is an
   excellent spell to use against a group of enemy troops. Cast on
   a central target who will burn its neighbours. This causes confusion
   and a scattering of troops, damage or death is a bonus. Then send in
   your troops to attack them. Invisibility works best when cast upon
   other mages. Use it to move them close to an enemy base and cause some
   devestation. Also cast it on a fast troop (Knight) to scout the enemy camp.
   However, I would usually use a Flying Machine for that purpose. By far the
   funniest spell is polymorph. Watch as a powerful troops gets transformed
   into a critter. It is also a very sneaky attack as the enemy has no warning.
   For pure devestation cast blizzard. Combine the mage's long range and
   the blizzard damage you can reduce defences to ruins. Ensure that your
   mage(s) are fully mana charged.

   Death Knights who are low on mana should cast death coil on the enemy
   to life drain their target. Cast haste on attacking troops to inflict
   more hits. For fun caste haste on peons so they fetch gold or harvest
   lumber in turbo mode. Raise dead is not a spell I find useful. You
   simply don't have time to calmly ressurect a skeleton army during a
   battle. Even the CPU never uses it. To cause confusion cast a few
   whirlwinds in the midst of a packed defence or enemy base. Whirlwinds
   also affect ships and flying creatures. Unholy armor halves the target's
   hit points in exchange for temporary invulnerability. Not used that often
   since it's effect is not long lasting. Use Death and Decay on enemy
   buildings to reduce them to rubble. Just as for blizzard make sure
   your Death Knights are fully mana charged.


   3.3 Suggested spells to use
   ---------------------------

   Playing as humans use your Paladins to heal your strong offensive
   troops usually other Paladins. Ballistas cannot be healed. The
   hated Death Knights should be despatched with Exorcism. Mages should
   be armed with Polymorph and Blizzard. Slow is worthless. Flame Shield
   can be useful against groups of troops but otherwise not worth
   researching. Invisibility is not very useful since mages have a long
   range anyway so can attack and run off. Use you mages for sneak attacks
   to occupy the enemy. Create six or more mages to set up a chain of
   attack and allowing them to recharge their mana. Avoid getting your
   mages too close to the enemy as they are defensively weak.

   Playing as orcs use your Ogre-Mages to Bloodlust all troops before
   launching an attack. Set runes where you expect the enemy to follow
   you. For your Death Knights cast Haste on bloodlusted troops for
   a fierce attack. Cast whirlwinds on ships or stacks of gryphons or
   dragons. These slow moving units will probably die. For variation
   cast Death Coil from long range to steal back hit points. Don't
   bother researching Raise Dead or Unholy Armor. Use Death and Decay
   on enemy towers and buildings.


4. Land campaigns
=================

   These are maps which are landlocked or consist of rivers crossed
   by bridges. These are maps in which no shipyards are built.

   4.1 Defense
   -----------

   Always use your terrain to your advantage. For example use forest
   around your base as a natural 'wall'. After initially building
   base try to explore your immediate area with a few troops. Work out
   possible entry points into your base. Use 'choke' points (constricted
   areas) to your advantage by securing these areas with ground troops.
   Above all try to locate a second and third goldmine and spread your
   base out over many areas (if the map is large enough). it is harder
   to target your base if it is in more than one place. You can also
   launch attacks from different bases. Upgrade you ground troop levels.
   Build towers and upgrade them to guard or cannon towers. Place these
   towers near important buildings and around your base. Guard towers
   are effective against ground troops (especially Bomb Squads and Sappers)
   and against air attacks from Gryphons/Dragons. Upgrade to cannon towers
   to kill the other ground troops. I don't worry too much about placement
   of troops. Just build lots of them. It is sensible to place archers
   or axethrowers behind stronger defensive units such as knights or ogres.
   Protect your slow moving ballistas or catapults. Build archers or
   axethrowers and upgrade them totally to fend off gryphon or dragon
   attacks. Don't bunch your archers/axethrowers against an attacking
   group of gryphons/dragons to avoid cumulative damage. Guard towers
   are also highly effective against air attacks.


   4.2 Offense
   -----------

   Once you have a decent defence you should seek out ways of destroying
   the enemy. Often the enemy builds a Hall close to a second goldmine
   and has peasants fetching gold from it. Quite often this second base is
   undefended so attack these first to slow the enemy's gold production
   and to gain easy kills.

   To attack the main base use your flying maching/zeppelin to scout
   out the base. If at all possible try to avoid being detected whilst
   scouting (not easy) so as to not alert the enemy as to your plans.
   Search for unguarded areas or weaknesses in the defence. Note where
   the enemy is strong or troops are gathered. Use mages/death knights
   to attack groups of troops or undefended buildings. Target towers
   initially. Soften up the enemy base by constantly causing disruption
   and forcing the enemy to repair structures. If there are few towers
   and archers/axethrowers left, use gryphons/dragons to safely attack
   the remaining ground troops. You will not suffer casualties. Otherwise
   send in a horde of 16 or more strong ground troops to storm the base.
   Target remaining ground troops and towers. Then once the base is
   defenceless raze the barracks first. Then optionally mage tower or
   temple of the damned. Hunt down all remaining peasants/peons (should
   be plenty of these). Then concentrate on the Castle/Fortress.


5. Sea campaigns
================

These are maps with large expanses of water. Land is mostly
separated into islands.

   5.1 Defense
   -----------

   Since you are on islands it is prudent to build away from the
   shoreline to avoid getting bombarded from the sea vessels. However,
   do build cannon towers on your shore to detect and attack incoming
   ships. Also build 3-4 ballistas/catapults to deal with ships. Be
   wary of enemy transports landing on your island. Therefore ensure
   you have sufficient ground troops to repulse such attacks. Send your
   flying machine/zeppelin on scouting missions. They also can see
   submarines which will otherwise bombard your ships and sea buildings.
   Your own submarines will detect enemy subs too. Protect your oil
   platforms by stationing battleships/juggernauts with a flying machine
   overhead to prevent submarine sneak attacks. Try to get off your island
   and build a second base if at all possible. Gold again could be the key.


   5.2 Offense
   -----------

   Planning an effective attack is difficult as in my opinion islands
   favour the defender. As in the land campaign use flying scouts to
   work out the best method of attack. Use 3 or more transports to unload
   18 (or more) tough ground troops simultaneously and go for mass
   slaughter. You might just win. If the target island is big try to land
   a mixture of troops and peasants/peons on it. Build a barracks or
   any other buildings of your choice on the same island as your enemy!
   Then build up a task force to send against the unsuspecting enemy.

   Another method is to rule the seas. To do this you will need a good
   size fleet of ships. Also build gryphons/dragons. Target destroyers
   first as they are the only ships which can kill your air units. Then
   you can sink the rest. Alternatively, sink all enemy submarines and
   destroy all enemy flying machine/zeppelins. Send a lone submarine to
   sink all the other hapless sea vessels. Once you control the waves
   bombard the shipyard first and then any other coastal structures.
   Beware of towers though. To despatch these concentrate en masse on
   each tower in turn to minimise casualties. Finally land troops via
   transports and do a combined ground and air attack.

6. Playing against the CPU
==========================

In multiplayer games against computer controlled opponents you
have to build adequate defences. The computer player builds up
its base very much quicker than you. However, it attacks as soon as
it has troops. One big attack would probably finish you but that
never happens ... Instead expect one lone soldier to attack your
base. The next attack consists of 3-5 soldiers. By now the CPU is
upgrading its troop levels too. Expect level 3 troops against your
level 1.

So how do you win? Try to copy the CPU tactics. Assume you both
start with one peasant/peon only. All build Hall, one farm.
The CPU player builds a second farm then a lumber mill (presume for
lumber prodiction bonus). Followed by a barracks and blacksmith.
Meantime it is churning out peasants/peons by the ton. Resources are
pouring in. Troops are built and sent towards you. All you have to do
is build a barracks and blacksmith after your initial hall and farm.
Build extra farms to support your peasants/peons and soldiers. Use
your barracks to exclusively produce footmen/grunts. Forget archers
or axethrowers as they die too quickly and waste time and money. Five
to six footmen/grunts should defned your base nicely. Upgrade them to
level 5 as soon as possible. Build 2 towers flanking your soldiers.
Upgrade them to cannon towers. The CPU hates towers and in a blind
frenzy attacks these first sustaining damage in the process. Your
footmen/grunts get first strike capability against the attackers
and suffer minimal damage.

This set up should defend against most CPU initial attacks. Upgrade
to stronger troops such as knights and ogres. Now build archers or
axethrowers to defend against air attacks. Try to stop the CPU
player from expanding. The sheer number of peasants/peons it produces
means that it exhausts its first goldmine before you do. It also
has spent most of it attacking you. If you can curb its search for
more mines then you have won. Build walls to block off goldmines, the
CPU never directly attacks walls. Don't be tempted to place towers
inside of the wall as it encourages the CPU to attack the towers
with ballistas/catapults or magic which can destroy your wall in the
process.

In summary the CPU attacks constantly at the beginning - so defend
well. Once you survive the initial onslaught you win by default.


7. Playing against friends
==========================

I use the word 'friends' in its loosest sense. Human players (non CPU)
show greater tactical ability. The best advice is to defend well using
the tactics described earlier. Then consider attacking options. Much
of your strategy will depend on several factors:

* Number of players
* Teamwork or deathplay (everyone for themselves)
* Skill of your opponents
* Favoured tactics of your opponents
* Your initial location
* Scenario selected

If you are feeling bold attack early with ground troops. Your base
would only consist of a Hall, some farms, barracks, blacksmith,
lumber mill. Your opponents won't be expecting such an attack and
(hopefully) be caught offguard. It is risky since you must win that
battle. If your attack is repulsed your base is now lightly defended
and prone to a counter attack.

Which race shall I play, Humans or Orcs? Personally I favour orcs
for their attack-orientated spells (Haste, Bloodlust). Axethrower
regeneration means that you can defend against air attacks
indefinitely without the logistic headache of healing each troop.
Also they burp and fart and have been given a bad press in the past.
Orcs rule!

Good luck with your campaigns and remember this: be WarCrafty.
